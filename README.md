# McBlog
This project was based on using the Django Frameworks to create a Blog website where I intend to in the future add 
my solutions to each of the problems that I solve on Leetcode. This also is a place where I discuss my thought processes 
upon each of the projects that I am doing and my opinions on different topics. I enjoyed learning and working with this full stack
framework to create my own website with some Python, Django and a little bit of HTML and CSS.
